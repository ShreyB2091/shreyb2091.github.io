I'm a first year MS CS student at Georgia Tech, having graduated from IIT Kanpur with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering.

I am interested in Computer Systems, Low-Level Programming, Systems for AI/ML, and Code Optimization Techniques. I am currently working on project [Vajra](https://project-vajra.github.io/), a low-latency distributed LLM inference serving engine, in the [Systems for AI Lab (SAIL)](https://gatech-sysml.github.io) at Georgia Tech. I am also working on building scalable database systems for AI-powered apps in the [DataBase Group](https://db.cc.gatech.edu) at Georgia Tech.
